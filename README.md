# color-combo-preview
Accepts different colors to composite an image


##Prerequisites

1. PHP + server of choice
2. [Image Magick] (http://www.imagemagick.org/)
3. Imagick (PHP plugin)

If you're on linux getting it running should be about as simple as apt-get install imagemagick php5-imagick
Specifics per OS will vary, but there are many guides online. Windows can be very finicky with imagick, you may want to use a virtual machine.


##Install / Run

None needed. Just clone into your web root, and see it on [localhost/color-combo-preview] (http://localhost/color-combo-preview) (Or whatever you may have named the folder)


##About

This is just a quick script to test different color combinations on a single item.
